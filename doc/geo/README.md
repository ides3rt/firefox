## Why this config don't disable "Geo Location"
Well... "Geo Location" is kinna pointless to disable, since as long as you connect to the internet they'll always know your location.

Q: "But, 'Geo Location' is improve accuracy" (i know it not a question)\
A: May be "improve accuracy" is even better 'cause your goddamn VPN will spoof your location anyway. (pls don't use VPNl lol, just use Tor)
