## Why this config doesn't disable "Geo Location"
Well... "Geo Location" is kinna pointless to disable, since as long as you
 connect to the internet they'll always know your location anyway.
 (it also create fingerprint)

Q: "But, 'Geo Location' is improve accuracy" (i know it not a question)\
A: May be "improve accuracy" is even better 'cause your goddamn VPN will spoof
 your location anyway. (pls don't use VPN lol, just use Tor)
